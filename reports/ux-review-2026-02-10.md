# Oxidian UX Review — 2026-02-10

Based on key learnings from 3 UI/UX design videos (Genius Web Design, Fix Boring UI, Obsidian CEO Vault Philosophy).

## 1. Settings Page — Theme Cards 🔴 Fixed

**Problem:** Theme cards use a flat `display: grid` with `minmax(120px, 1fr)` but lack visual hierarchy. No hover glow, no inner depth, active state has only a border change — boring.

**Fixes applied:**
- Compact card size (max 110px wide feeling, better grid fit)
- **Hover:** Medium shadow + subtle scale + border glow
- **Active:** Accent glow ring (`box-shadow` with accent color), gradient inner highlight, stronger text color
- **Light mode:** Proper shadow adjustments (lighter, not just dark shadows)
- Preview swatch gets subtle inner glow on active

---

## 2. Sidebar — Depth & Layered Shades 🟡 Improved

**Problem:** Sidebar is flat — single `--bg-sidebar` with no layered depth. The `#tags-section` border is just a 1px line. No inner shadow, no gradient, no sense of "layers."

**Fixes applied:**
- Sidebar gets a subtle **inner shadow** on the right edge (depth illusion)
- Tags section gets a **layered shade** background (slightly different from sidebar bg)
- Sidebar panel header gets a very subtle bottom gradient fade
- File tree hover items get a **left accent border glow** on hover
- Active tree items get enhanced glow effect

## 3. Remember Panel — Empty State Bug 🔴 Found & Documented

**Problem:** The HTML (`index.html`) has a static `#panel-remember` with an empty `<div id="remember-panel"></div>` inside. The JS `remember.js` also calls `injectSidebarPanel()` which creates a *second* `#panel-remember` div with `#remember-dashboard` inside. 

**Root cause:** The HTML-defined panel wins (it's there first and gets `.active` class), but its child `#remember-panel` div is never populated. The JS-injected panel with `#remember-dashboard` gets appended *after* the existing one and never gets activated.

**Fix:** Updated the HTML panel to include `id="remember-dashboard"` div matching what the JS expects. The JS `injectSidebarPanel()` should check if the panel already exists before creating a duplicate. **CSS-side: added empty-state styling for the remember panel.**

## 4. General "Boring UI" Fixes 🟢 Applied

### 4a. Shadows — 3 Levels (Video 2 Key Learning)
- **`--shadow-sm`**: `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.03) inset` (subtle, light top border)
- **`--shadow-md`**: `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25), 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.04) inset` (hover state)  
- **`--shadow-lg`**: `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.4), 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.05) inset` (modals)

### 4b. Light Mode Neglect (Video 2)
- Added proper light mode shadow overrides
- Theme card light mode hover uses lighter shadows
- Sidebar light mode gets subtle depth treatment

### 4c. Selected States (Video 2)
- Settings nav active item: brighter accent + subtle left bar glow
- Theme card active: inner glow + accent text
- Tab active: already has accent bar ✓ — enhanced with subtle glow

### 4d. Micro-interactions (Video 1)
- Theme card selection: spring animation on click ✓ (already existed)
- Added hover scale to theme preview swatches
- Dashboard cards: already have translateY hover ✓

## Summary of CSS Changes

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/css/style.css` | Shadow system, sidebar depth, theme card redesign, light mode fixes, selected states |
| `src/css/remember.css` | Dashboard card depth, panel empty state, sidebar panel layering |
| `src/index.html` | Fixed remember panel child div id |

---

## Remaining Recommendations (No CSS fix needed)

1. **JS Fix needed:** `remember.js` `injectSidebarPanel()` should check `if (document.getElementById('panel-remember'))` before creating a new one
2. **Content gap:** Remember sidebar panel needs nav items rendered even with 0 cards (show onboarding state)
3. **Graph View:** Could benefit from depth/glow treatment on nodes (future sprint)
